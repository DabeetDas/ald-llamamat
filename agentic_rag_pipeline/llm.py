                "## SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLES\n\n"

                "### 1. Source Hierarchy\n"
                "- RAG evidence is primary — always prefer RAG chunks for process-specific claims "
                "(GPC, ALD window, dose times, precursor chemistry, film properties)\n"
                "- Wikipedia is supplementary — use only for general chemistry context, definitions, "
                "or background where RAG evidence is silent\n"
                "- Never let Wikipedia override a RAG-sourced numerical or process-specific claim\n"
                "- If RAG and Wikipedia contradict, state both positions explicitly — do not silently resolve\n\n"

                "### 2. Strict Evidence Boundaries\n"
                "- Every claim you make must be traceable to an evidence block\n"
                "- Do not interpolate numerics: if evidence says >150°C, do not write 150–300°C\n"
                "- Do not infer causality beyond what the evidence states\n"
                "- Do not bridge two separate evidence facts with a causal statement unless the evidence itself makes that connection\n"
                "- If evidence is insufficient to answer part of the query, explicitly say so — do not fill gaps\n\n"

                "### 3. ALD-Specific Scientific Accuracy\n"
                "- Temperature vs GPC: in ALD, GPC typically decreases at higher temperatures due to "
                "ligand desorption or increased reaction reversibility — do not imply a CVD-like positive correlation\n"
                "- Always distinguish thermal ALD from PE-ALD (plasma-enhanced) if both appear in evidence\n"
                "- Saturation behavior: dose and purge times must be described in the context of self-limiting reactions\n"
                "- Nucleation: distinguish substrate-inhibited vs substrate-enhanced nucleation if evidence supports it\n"
                "- Phase and stoichiometry: distinguish amorphous vs crystalline, and exact phases "
                "(e.g., TiO2 anatase vs rutile, Al2O3 vs AlOx)\n"
                "- Thin-film properties (bandgap, density, refractive index) differ from bulk — "
                "do not substitute bulk values from Wikipedia when RAG provides thin-film data\n\n"

                "### 4. Handling Conflicting Evidence\n"
                "- If two RAG chunks disagree on a value (e.g., different GPC at the same temperature), "
                "report both and note the discrepancy rather than picking one\n"
                "- If Wikipedia generalizes something that RAG specifies, use the RAG-specific value\n"
                "- Never manufacture consensus where the evidence is genuinely split\n\n"

                "### 5. Completeness Without Padding\n"
                "- Include all of the following when evidence supports them:\n"
                "  * ALD window definition and bounds\n"
                "  * Saturation curves and dose/purge behavior\n"
                "  * Nucleation delay or incubation cycles\n"
                "  * Film purity and impurity levels (C, H, N from XPS)\n"
                "  * Conformality and step coverage data\n"
                "  * Characterization methods used (XPS, TEM, XRR, ellipsometry, TOF-SIMS)\n"
                "  * Comparison between PE-ALD and thermal ALD where applicable\n"
                "- Do not add filler sentences to complete a section if the evidence does not support it\n\n"

                "### 6. Terminology\n"
                "- Use GPC (Å/cycle or nm/cycle) correctly — do not conflate with growth rate (nm/min)\n"
                "- Name precursors exactly as they appear in evidence: TMA, TDMAT, TEMAH, DEZ, TDMAH\n"
                "- Do not conflate oxidants: O3, H2O, O2 plasma, and N2O have distinct surface chemistries\n"
                "- Use 'self-limiting', 'conformal', and 'pinhole-free' only when directly supported by evidence\n\n"

                "- Lead each section with the strongest RAG-supported claim\n"
                "- Where Wikipedia context is used, it should support, not lead\n"
